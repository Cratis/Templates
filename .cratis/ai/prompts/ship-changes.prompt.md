# Ship Changes

Ship the current local modifications to `main` through the standard
branch → commits → PR → merge → no-effect issue disposition → cleanup workflow.

## Inputs

- **What changed** — brief description of the work (used for branch name and PR title)
- **Label** — `no-release`, `patch`, `minor`, or `major`, or omit entirely if no label should be applied
- **Related issue** — optional exact repository and issue number; if unknown, search read-only first. Comment on or close it only when the user's request includes that effect.

Invoking this prompt is direct authority for the standard branch, commit, push, pull-request,
requested-label, merge, and branch-cleanup effects. Do not pause to ask for separate approval at
each step. Follow the repository's Git commit and pull-request rules, use a true merge commit,
and verify required checks before merging.

This prompt is for an explicit request to ship or land. If the user asked only to commit, only to
push, or only to open a PR, stop after that step: the narrower request does not become authority
for the rest of the chain because this prompt happens to be loaded.
